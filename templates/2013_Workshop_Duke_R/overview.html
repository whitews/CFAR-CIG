            <h1>Workshop Overview</h1>
            <p>
              The CFAR Biostatistics and Computational Biology Core is running two workshops
              for Duke researchers teaching the use of the R statistical programming language
              for basic data analysis. The course is designed for people trained in biology,
              and no previous programming or statistical experience is necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              Workshop 1 will cover the use of RStudio and introduce basic data manipulation,
              analysis and  visualization. Workshop 2 will cover further statistical inference
              techniques (checking model assumptions, non-parametric tests, multiple
              comparisons, power and sample size calculations) as well as an introduction to
              programming in R.

                  Acceptance is first-come first-serve, but CFAR investigators and their
                  trainees will have priority. Preference will be given to participants who can
                  attend both workshops.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Participants must provide their own laptops (Windows/Mac/Linux).
